# Description
We examine patterns in NBA player performance during the 2024–25 season through three key dimensions: position, efficiency, and age. Using descriptive statistics and visualizations in R, we analyze whether scoring output differs by player position, whether higher three-point attempt rates are associated with greater shooting efficiency, and whether older players rely more on free throws as part of their scoring strategy. By focusing on players averaging at least 15 minutes per game, the analysis aims to uncover meaningful trends among consistent contributors and highlight how player roles and experience shape on-court performance.
